I continue to polish many aspects of the engine to make shiny my precious!
Also, I have moved my builds from TravisCI to GitHub Actions.
Because of a new policy for open source projects from TravisCI.
Hope it will help me deliver builds more easily and stable.

Thunder Engine 2021.3 is now available for download.
