In this release I have focused on refactoring of Editor.

I'm trying to isolate existent functionality to modules and I'm close to this.
It will allow understanding what developers will need to create their own modules for the Games and for the Editor.
The other side of development which I keep focused on is related to the stabilization of Thunder Engine and UX improvements.
I hope you will like to use new Hierarchy features.
Timeline functionality was also stabilized.
I did a lot of work to make the Linux version of Thunder Engine more stable and usable.
I wish the next year will bring more interesting features to the Thunder Engine.
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
