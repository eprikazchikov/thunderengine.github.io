Hello and welcome to new release of Thunder Engine.
In this release, I have focused to prepare to jump to the modern graphical APIs.
This was required some refactoring in the graphical pipeline and how user data will be handled in the shaders.
Unfortunately, this required activity was led to increasing in the OpenGL version for the desktop platforms.
And the MacOS version of the editor becomes temporarily unavailable.
I have plans to provide Metal support as soon as possible.
But at this moment I have no Mac to do this.
I hope you will understand this temporal discomfort. 

Also expanded the documentation.
I hope the engine will become a little clearer with it.
If you have questions about the engine, you can always ask me.
And remember, your questions form the basis of future documentation and new versions of the engine.
Help me prioritize my activities! 

Thunder Engine 2022.1 is now available for download.
