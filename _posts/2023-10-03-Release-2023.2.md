Greetings and welcome to the latest Thunder Engine release!

I apologize for the extended period without updates, and I appreciate your patience. Rest assured, I remain committed to supporting and enhancing this project, albeit at a slightly reduced pace.

In this new release, I've dedicated significant effort to refactor the existing code within the graphics subsystem. The fruit of this meticulous work is the introduction of the "Flexible Pipeline." This pipeline is a novel resource utilized by the Pipeline Context to determine the sequence and quantity of PipelineTasks to execute, as well as facilitating the exchange of execution results between tasks. This innovation empowers you with unparalleled control and optimization over the Graphics Pipeline, allowing you to tailor it precisely to your requirements.

Moreover, I've introduced support for Computer shaders in this release, with plans to further expand their utility in upcoming releases. This enhancement opens up exciting possibilities for your projects.

One more highlight of this release is the revamp of the materials editor. It now includes new nodes, and most notably, you have the freedom to incorporate your custom nodes using XML and GLSL. This means you can extend the functionality of the materials editor to suit your specific needs and creative vision.

Below, you'll find a comprehensive list of all the new features and fixes that have been included in this release. Thank you for your continued support, and I look forward to bringing you even more exciting developments in the future!
